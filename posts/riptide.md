I wade through the words that have hit me like waves

I rationalize the reasons until I am pulled under, again in a riptide.

My senses are overwhelmed.

The current carries me to the floor where the sand and stones scratch my skin.

I lash at the water longing for something to latch onto.

I can only taste salt, the stinging on my skin is now numb.

Suddenly I struggle to swim.

The water still swirls around me still filling my senses.

The current makes one final claw at my ankle.

I am free.

I am exhausted.

I am still drowning.

I finally surface

and see how far from shore I have come.

I never should have gone into such troubled waters alone.
