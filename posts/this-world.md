Caffeine!

My  Cardiac muscle tries to escape it

It sends off a warning throughout my body

<br/>
The gong has been rung

And its vibrations run to my finger-tips

That are unable to keep steady.

<br/>
My senses heighten

My muscles are twitching

And my thoughts are frightening

At such speed.

<br/>
My mouth slurs the words

I am struggling to say without spitting.

<br/>
Coworkers must think I’m crazy,

And I probably look it.

<br/>
I jumped out of bed,

They must think I’m lazy.

<br/>
I ran into work,

My hair is still wet.

<br/>
My makeup is done,

Or so I thought…

It wasn’t till noon when I realized what I forgot.

<br/>
My eye-shadow is on-point,

But my lashes are bare.

<br/>
The promise of potential,

Keeps me from despair.

<br/>
I must look like a fool,

Because I’m trying to learn.

<br/>
This world of work-force whirlwind,

is not made for aspiracious  students.
