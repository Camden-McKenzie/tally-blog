For you, unfortunate friend light flickers

keeping me up at night-—

casting creeping shadows on my wall.

As I learn more, the light burns brighter

white, purple, and now red stripes.

Waxing sadness befalls me.

I use the light to show you

how to find help and healing.

Wax needs molding while it’s

hot.

For you, I lit a blazing candle

and it burns ever brightly

before my brimming mind

but you refuse my guidance

preferring peers to professionals

exchanging pity for pity.

you complain about hunger

while forking the food I provided–

you refuse to enjoy is sustenance.

I learn about your decisions—

though I am next door,

but a forgotten neighbor.

My wick is burning bronze

the flickers seldom keep me

from sound slumber now.

I lit flame to candle

and since lit many more

but if I’m to burn

 another ounce

 of wax

You need

to give

the next

match.
