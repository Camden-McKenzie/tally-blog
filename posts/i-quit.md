I quit.

I quit that bullshit,

and it’s been a bit,

but looking back I bet

It was the best call.

I left.

I left the losing.

I left because I felt lost

at the end of my day.

I roamed around looking for a home

‘though I had one.

I regret

nothing I did

or have done since.

I would change things, if

I went back in time. but if leaving

was still a question?

I give the same answer.

I lie still: relaxed.

I stand firm: resolved.

I move forward: happy.

When I think of you, I grow sad

at your display.

but I don’t

dwell on you long

anymore.

I am my own person again,

forevermore.
