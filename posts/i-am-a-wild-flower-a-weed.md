My life is a recycling realm.

My existence is a nuisance.

No one notices my novelty.

<br/>
Slayed with spray,

only some survive.

Still several sigh at our sight.

<br/>
I begin to bud with a blossom,

and am ripped at as they grip my green leaves.

They tear them from me to mash in their teeth.

<br/>
As terrible as it sounds,

some part of me is happy.

It is nice to be noticed and not neglected.

<br/>
I finally flower and am fertile.

I glow golden, glad.

My head is heaved high and left to die.

<br/>
Until gathered into a golden pile,

watered from a glass vile.

My gold turns grey in just one day.

<br/>
If left to live,

which is what I like best,

I lighten the land.

<br/>
When my colors finally fade

I wait for the breeze,

to carry my seed with ease.

<br/>
But before this begins,

I am most beloved by beings

because of what they believe.

<br/>
I am their promises, picked.

I am their wishes, blown.

I am their future, kept.

<br/>
I am a wild flower, a weed.
