So much stress and strain with such little gain. The target and motivation are becoming bleak and blurry. My heart twangs with a new pain and furry. So much hurt unhealed. So much heart concealed. My head refuses submission, but my mouth doesn’t seem to have permission. Permission to speak my mind clearly and cleverly, to articulate artfully. Whispering weakly or scream and steam at what is mean, melting into a pathetic puddle is what I do. The in between remains unseen. My head holds helpful words, but my mouth won’t motion a move. Fearing failure, I flee, but to my own misery! They are all too occupied, there is no opportunity, or if the rarity should occur, I couldn’t find courage to convey what for so long has been concealed.

It is sad that I have no more words to write on this topic that could bring delight. Pain brings pressure that pushes everything out of sight that could be bright. Focus on fear and count every tear. Hold your silence, shout out now. Thankless thoughts to dwell on.

We moan and fuss with such little trust. Pain has a purpose, this it must.
