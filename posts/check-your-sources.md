Since 2015 there has been a shift, a tangible shift, in how we engage in important informative conversations. The shift grew, I think, substantially with the 2016 presidential race, and promotion and use of the phrase “fake news”.

Living in a country which prides itself on free press and free speech, Americans have always read the news with a grain of salt, looking at each article critically. In current times, I have noticed a shift, even in simple conversation; the view I have found is self-righteous, extreme and dangerous. It is the dismissal of all news, as fraudulent regardless of their sources. It lends itself to ignorance, indifference, and ironically misinformation.

It is dangerous, particularly for America, because of how dependent a successful democracy is on having an educated and informed people. It is for this very reason freedom of speech and freedom of press were established from the beginning. It is for this reason Americans have the right to receive mail. Dismissal typically stems from one of two places: 1)an educated cross analysis that immediately disproves of a specific statement, or 2) indifference. The one I am focusing on is the latter.

Everyone hears the news. Some freely search it out, others hear it by word of mouth from friends, family, or coworkers. Individuals who passively receives the news, despite their “fake news” justifications as to why they don’t search it out themselves, they are actually most susceptible to misinformation.

I am concerned, that in this age of shorter attention spans, individuals aren’t making the time to find the source of their information. If nothing is cited in your news, you probably shouldn’t trust it. If something is cited, maybe you should read what your source is citing and get to the root of the information. Scroll to the bottom, click the link; google the article it cites. Never settle for second hand reporting. It’s a good heated sound bite, but it rarely has the facts and is almost always just an opinion.

Just like this.

In my own personal search to answer this, I was recommended looking into a lawyer who has dedicated herself to fighting bias and protecting intellectual property: Vanessa Otero. Her media bias chart has had wide circulation and push back since 2016. Let me know what you think of it.
