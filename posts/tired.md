Awake and struggling to stay.

Sleep swims through my mind swarming my senses;

When will I wander off next?

I calculate.

<br/>
The clock climbs at a crawl,

Clicking but clinging to each hour.

The day is full but my effort is failing.

I deflate.

<br/>
Struggling to stimulate my cells

The day drags me down

Draining my desire to stay diligent.

I caffeinate.

<br/>
Jitters and shaking fingers

Flustered I fidget and struggle to sit.

My heart pounding perpetually.

Sleep perpetuates.

<br/>
Sleepâ€™s soothing voice still seduces.

Finally I slip off slowly,

Drifting deep into the dark together.

We consummate.
