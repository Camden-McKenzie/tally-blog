Allow me to begin by stating the reality and damage of emotion trauma and abuse. No one would dare say to a veteran that the PTSD that they have is nothing, or that they should just be grateful that they weren’t physically harmed in combat. Despite this, I know many-a-boomer who would claim that mental abuse is nothing compared to the physical abuse they endured as children. Or that children these days are soft and privileged. Privileged they may be, but trauma is trauma and abuse is abuse. It is just as real, just as serious, and can be just as permanent.

I know several parents whose adult children have cut ties with them. I know the parents, and I know the children. [Twelve](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/family-estrangement-why-families-cut-ties-and-how-to-mend-them/) percent of parents are estranged from one or more of their children. While I am sympathetic to the parental pain that is borne by the parent, I will be taking to side of the child. I am going to be making their case, mostly because in all of the relationships I have observed, it is the parents who strained the relationship to breaking. Even though all of them claim that they don’t understand how their child could cut them off so heartlessly.

Let’s make one thing clear. Of the several adult children who I know who gained the courage to separate their lives from their parents, all of them found the decision difficult and painful. All of them experience the similar feeling of loss and unlove. They have all made the decision for their mental health. They never wanted the decision, but they’ve also never regretted it.

Adult children who have ended relationships with their parents almost always, at one point or another, tried to explain why— either before or after their decision. Most often though, the parent isn’t receptive or able to recognize the attempt and ends it prematurely and abruptly. Children don’t just wake up one morning and decide that the day has finally come to cut off a parent. There was a moment that epitomized all the other moments before, where the child decided they had endured enough. They decided the chronic pain that came with the parent-relationship, was now greater than the pain that would come if they ended the relationship.

Emotional abuse is real, and often hard to identify by outsiders. Few children are ever saved from it. It comes in the form of incessant yelling; outrageous punishments for the simplest offense; emotional unburdening onto children; over sharing details that young minds are not capable of processing healthily; favoritism of a single child when there are many; neglect; deprivation of outsider socialization; limiting of opportunity and growth; forced relationships with hand-selected friends; disregard for their child’s complaints; disallowment of any privacy; chronic or blind hatred for a partner clearly displayed in front of their children. These are just some of the common examples displayed by mentally abusive parents but there are often many more that accompany them.

The bond between a parent and child is strong, natural, and constant. No adult child takes the decision lightly, and many by the time they finally reach their breaking point, are so confident in their decision that they stand by if for years, if not a life time. That is years worth of holidays, birthdays and vacations without their parent, a sacrifice they continually renew with each passing occasion resisting the urge to reach out, regardless of how badly they would have liked to have a healthy parent-child relationship.

No one is perfect, everyone is hurting. Sometimes though, it hurts less to be alone than to face yet more emotional abuse or manipulation. The lack of a relationship is better, than the obligatory relationship that preexisted it.

Children never asked to be born. Parents chose to make and keep them. By doing this they assumed full responsibility for them, for their needs, and for their well being. To neglect any one of these would be gross parenting. Adult children owe their parents nothing. What you gave as parents – you gave out of obligation, not generosity, even though you may have felt it generous, you merely did your parental duty. They owe you nothing.

—Final thoughts

I have often heard the Bible quoted at me when I make this claim. “Honor thy father and mother”, fair enough it is one of the commandments after all, however, immediately following Ephesians 6:4, tells parents not to provoke their children to anger; and Colossians 3:21 says do not embitter your children. Like everything, its a two ways street. Abusers no longer can demand respect from their children. Needless to say most of the parents that demand this kind of respect, don’t show it to anyone.

*This is not about my parents, I have a relationship with both. This is purely observational, and research based.*
