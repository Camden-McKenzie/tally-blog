I went on a roller coaster;

I had never been before.

Rides don’t scare me, so I didn’t hesitate.

<br/>
It rolled in fast;

It rolled in loud.

As the conductor squealed the brake.

<br/>
I took the last seat;

It was in the center.

Seat-belts and bars secured, I elevate.

<br/>
It brought me up slow;

It showed me the view.

The sky was clouded but blue in the pine tree state.

<br/>
It clawed its way up, clanking;

Until it reached reached 100 feet.

I saw and I stared to the side as I gravitate.

<br/>
Suddenly it slipped;

I fell over the edge.

My lungs fill with air as I suffocate.

<br/>
I plummet and stare;

I look to the side.

The trees are my only comfort; I tolerate.

<br/>
As fast as I fell,

It whipped me about.

It jerk to its side continuing to accellerate.

<br/>
Fifty- five miles an hour,

It wizzed onward.

I hold on tightly shocked by the incredible rate.

<br/>
It jerked me around;

It roared at each turn.

The screaming sound surrounding me, I can not overstate.

<br/>
Crimping corners

It cuts curves quickly.

The speed of the ride appeared to culminate.

<br/>
I couldn’t scream;

I couldn’t speak.

I struggled to pronunciate.

<br/>
It finally slowed;

It finally stopped.

Finished in under two minutes, I estimate.

<br/>
I exit my seat;

I stumble to the side.

I see the several more lie in wait.

<br/>
I have had my fill;

I don’t regret it.

Two is too many, but once, is great.
