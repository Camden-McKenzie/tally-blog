So surrounded, you feel alone.

So well known, you lost yourself.

<br/>
Friends flatter themselves at your flaws,

but to your face say “Ooo’s” and “Awwes”.

Why so much applause? You wonder.

Why must they roar in your face – thunder.

<br/>
Distance. Solitude.

Alone in an open field.

Slowly you see the darkness gather,

growing closer.

<br/>
It envelopes.

Where are your hands,

that I might hold them?

<br/>
Away! Away!

Wondering. Lost? No.

You know where you are.

Wishing amnesia.

Memories replay like an old tape.

You wish to escape.

<br/>
To forget happiness.

What is contentment?

Faster. Faster!

Busy. Busy!

<br/>
What is happiness? Who is content? Why am I alone?

Thoughts trickle down your face.

Your head is damp and cold.

Chattering, then mumbling. Fierce!

<br/>
It grips you tightly by the throat.

Your mouth is open.

Your cheeks are wet.

Air! It is cold.

<br/>
The grass is cold upon your bare knees;

but to your face, warm.

<br/>
Shivers. Chills spread up your spine.

Alone. You hope forgotten,

But a loud shout in your head reminds you.

<br/>
Whispers whip through the ground to your ears.

Ripping at you.

Dust then mud.

You shudder, now shaking.

<br/>
A flutter in you stirs,

flopping you onto your back.

Face: flooded, flushed. Flash!

<br/>
You saw! You saw them fleeing before you.

You felt their presence- absent. Alone.

You are relieved, and relax.

Air around- oxygen.

<br/>
Hecklers hacking as they hurry away.

Finally alone.

Happy?
