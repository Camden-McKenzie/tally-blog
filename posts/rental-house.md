The house is so empty, I’ve started talking to thin air. (Care?)

Care? I don’t mind, I’ll just put away the dishes and silverware. (Where?)

In the Drawer where they belong. (Long)

No, I don’t mind that the house is empty. (Empty)

I have friends, they’re just busy. (Busy?)

Yes! I’m busy too. (You?)

Don’t mock me! (Me?)

If you keep it up, I’ll leave! (Leave?)

Yeah, I’ll go to a coffee shop. (Shop?)

Hhhh… I do need groceries. (geeze!)

Hey! Shopping requires energy. (Energy?)

Right, I could get a coffee. (Oof!)

You know what! (What?)

I’m leaving now! (Ow!)
