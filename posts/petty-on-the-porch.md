Pettily he put my pots

out on the porch steps.

Claiming that he had

perceived a stench, from

their five day resting.

since then I have put

the two sanitized pots

safely back into their spots:

under the counter.

I can taste your bitter

passive rage boiling like

the pasta sauce did

on Tuesday last.

I see the psychedelic smile;

I grind my teeth at your squirrel

like cackle– but I stay silent

despite your jabs for a conflict.

I will not gift, this pupil-like pettiness

which you seem to find particularly

serendipitous; I will not grant you

a brawl!

<br/>
Yet a brawl you must have, and so do,

but not with me. I now sit in serenity, while

you maul at your own flesh with the words you wish me to hear–

if I but provoke them.

and I partake with satisfaction,

in my own psychotic way–

knowing I wasted all the preparation you put

into such a monologous meeting

<br/>
I will be absent from.
