Excitement exudes from my ecstatic face.

My quest’s completion comes quickly.

Tedious time taken pays off.

The finish line rushes towards me.

<br/>
I am happy.

I receive the medal.

I ponder.

<br/>
I am scared by the next step,

This status adds pressure.

Takes time, and limits time.

<br/>
Requires dedication and limits.

I consider if regrets will follow,

I hope I don’t leave hollow.

<br/>
I chose to try this task.

I chose to change fast.

I rearrange my revolving schedule.

<br/>
Only time will tell if this toll is worth it.
