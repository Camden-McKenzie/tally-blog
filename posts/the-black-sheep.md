Differences are definitely distinguishable.

You appear alike, around your flock.

You look and speak like all the other sheep.

<br/>
Simple and shy, and never appearing to cry.

You do your days work diligently,

Never neglecting a need.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You can appear to act like all the others in the flock.

Except your independence is inevitable.

Yet you are intrinsically in-tune with the invisible interests of others:

Noticing, little things, like moods and meanings.

<br/>
Concerned with the amount people care.

You question, concerned for others,

And cannot quite enjoy yourself alone.

Productivity is rewarding but not chronic.

<br/>
In reality you cry alone at everyone’s pain.

You cry at home at everyone’s gain.

Silently sad and glad for the people around you.

Concerned and quietly caring.

<br/>
You have cried for love,

You have cried for loss,

You cry an embarrassing amount for others.

<br/>
So to everyone else who knows

you are the black sheep in this flock,

They should know:

This black sheep is golden.
