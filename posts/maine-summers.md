Its Muggy and Muddy out.

The Sun is too hot;

The breeze is too cold.

Ticks abound

And when the sun goes down-

Mosquitoes swarm.

When the sun is out-

Horse and deer flies devour:

They spear and they suck,

Leaving bumps where they bite.

Poison Ivy itches and blisters.

Lakes provide little relief-

As leaches latch too.

Snappers, snakes, and spiders disturb the surface of the water.

Oceans are freezing,

Their sand is burning and their

Seagulls snatch at all your snacks

And sand-fleas leave you with a rash.

Things ointment and spray might relieve

So no, Iâ€™d NEVER leave.
