Air adjusts to the position of the earth.

<br/>
The grass changes: green to gray;

Green leaves grow gold.

Birds come and go based on the seasons.

<br/>
Each and every season has its peeks, and its misery.

<br/>
See that we also have our seasons.

Our mood, our fellows, our outlook;

All is affected by the atmosphere.

<br/>
We adjust with trust,

that the seasons will return in due time.

<br/>
At current we might be able to grow,

But just know,

That a time will come, where you must survive.

<br/>
So survive.

The time will come to grow.

For now, focus

On simply surviving.
