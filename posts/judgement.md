Sometimes its painful to look at the past.

Present perceptions adjust your previous judgments.

A better understanding of reality;

A piece of new information.

It can cut you from your anchor.

Sending you out to torturous sea of regrets,

With reality finally resonating.

What you thought was righteous,

What you thought was wrong,

really was rather different.

You were extreme, unbalanced, and rigid.

You are no more.

I see the difference, I choose to care,

I choose to change, I choose to share.

I choose not you.
