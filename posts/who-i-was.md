I struggle to see

Who I was and am now

filtering facts to find my persona.

<br/>
I wonder at who I was;

I consider conscientiously

what qualities I still carry.

<br/>
Memories muddle my mind

Manipulating my perception.

Which ones are still relevant?

<br/>
The child inside coos comfort,

But careful consideration calls into question

how much of its content survived.

<br/>
Have I become better or lost my preferred self?

Have my old friends failed me?

Have my new friends helped and healed me?

<br/>
I fret feverishly fascinated,

wondering at who has been created,

who has been lost, and how much.

<br/>
New experiences have happened

But to whom? I will not know

Until I again look back and I am gone, once more.
