Soaked in stains

Rusty red receptacles

Crusty and crumb covered.

<br/>
Vile veggies and a variety of

Pasta sauce paste the pile

Overlooked and obviously overflowing.

<br/>
The spray hose on the sink

Is now the easiest way to drink.

Heaving at the hose,

Struggling; it sticks then slips.

<br/>
The water tastes dirty,

Or is it just spoiled

by the smell of the sink?

<br/>
Pots and pans piled high

But I am the only one to sigh.
