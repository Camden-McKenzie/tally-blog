Spring has sprung

and new lifeâ€™s begun.

Bushes are bright with

Budding berries,

Flies and flowers,

sunshine and showers.

Longer days,

Brighter hours.

People and pets

enjoying pleasant rays.

Grass is now green

and new birds can be seen.

Bambis are born while bugs

and butterflies abound.

All critters chitter and chatter

while trying to get fatter.

Time is better spent because

new dreams are being dreamt.
