Fickle and unpredictable they call me;

Brisk and cold they complain;

Hostile humidity hurts their lungs they hack;

Scratching from stinging insect inflicted pain.

Allergies attack their sinuses.

The days are short and the nights are cold;

The slushie snow and ice are slick.

All my residents are getting old,

Heating is high and blankets are thick,

Food is expensive and stamps are common;

Shelters are full and helplines are flashin’.

Isolating solitude is coming,

The young are fresh out of passion.

The Mainer’s love for me is inconsistent.

They swear they’ll never leave ME,

They make statements of potential and commitment:

They’ll wait out the cold night.

They say they love all my seasons,

But they only love me when the sun shines – just right.
